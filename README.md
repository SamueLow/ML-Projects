# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my journey in learning and implementing Machine Learning algorithms. The projects included here are a combination of my original work and the tutorials I've followed in order to learn different concepts. 

## Overview

The main purpose of this repository is to document my progress as I deepen my understanding of Machine Learning. It contains a range of projects, from basic concepts to more advanced topics, such as Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

## Key Projects

### Custom Neural Network

This project involves creating a custom neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The code for this project can be found in the `custom_nn.py` file. The neural network is implemented using only numpy, providing a deeper understanding of how neural networks work under the hood.

## Learning Resources

My journey in Machine Learning has been largely self-directed, taking advantage of various online resources to learn and improve my skills. Here are some of the courses and tutorials that I've found most helpful:

1. [AI for Everyone by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)
2. [MIT Deep Learning series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI)
3. [3Blue1Brown's Machine Learning principles on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
4. [Sebastian Lague's tutorials on creating a neural network](https://youtu.be/hfMk-kjRv4c)
5. [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)

## Future Plans

I am constantly learning and planning to update this repository with new projects as I continue my journey in Machine Learning. My current learning path includes focusing on more advanced Deep Learning concepts and applying them to real-world problems.
